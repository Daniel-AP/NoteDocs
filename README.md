# NoteDocs

NoteDocs is a desktop notes application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript.

It started for a simple reason. The default Windows Notes app didn’t let me paste images and at the time it also didn’t support Markdown-style formatting. For technical notes that quickly became limiting. Instead of switching tools, I built one that handled images, structured content, and multiple open documents properly.

The project focuses not just on features but on building a clean Electron architecture with clear process boundaries and predictable state management.

Currently tested on Windows.

The app also includes a dedicated shortcuts panel for quick reference.

The panel is accessible via `Ctrl + K` and provides an overview of navigation, formatting, and document management shortcuts.

## Architecture

The application is built with a clear separation between processes.

The main process manages window lifecycle, file system access, and application shutdown. All file operations are intentionally restricted to the main process to prevent the UI layer from accessing the operating system directly.

The preload layer exposes a minimal API to the renderer. This keeps system-level capabilities isolated and avoids mixing UI logic with OS access.

The renderer contains the React interface, editor logic, and application state. It does not access Node APIs directly. All communication with the system occurs through IPC.

Application shutdown is explicitly controlled. The main process intercepts the close event, the renderer evaluates unsaved changes, and termination proceeds only after confirmation. This prevents silent data loss and ensures consistent state handling.

## Data Modeling

The core model revolves around tabs.

### 1. Tab

Each tab represents an open document.

A tab contains

- A unique identifier  
- The document content as structured JSON  
- The file path if the document has been saved  
- An unsaved changes flag  

Tabs are stored in an in-memory collection and there is always one active tab.

Keeping tabs fully in memory allows fast switching and independent change tracking per document.

### 2. Document

Documents are not stored as plain text.

Content is stored as structured JSON generated by Tiptap. This structure represents nodes such as paragraphs, headings, lists, images, and formatted text.

Using a structured model preserves formatting and embedded media without requiring manual parsing.

Before saving, the document structure is validated to avoid persisting invalid data.

### 3. Global State

State is divided into three parts

- Application state for tabs, active tab, and unsaved changes  
- Editor state for the current editor instance  
- Modal state for dialog visibility  

State is separated by responsibility instead of centralized into a single store. This keeps update flows clear and avoids unnecessary dependencies between unrelated parts of the UI.

## Editor Implementation

The editor is built on Tiptap with custom extensions.

It supports direct image pasting, automatic URL linking, input rules for text transformation, and structured formatting such as headings, lists, code blocks, and alignment.

Text transformations are implemented as editor rules rather than post-processing. This keeps behavior aligned with the editor’s internal document model.
